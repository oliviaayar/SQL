In this project, I have created a tabe and answered the following questions about the dataset. 

1. Create a table named friends with three columns: id that stores INTEGER, name that stores TEXT, birthday that stores DATE. 
  CREATE TABLE friends (
    id INTEGER, 
    name TEXT, 
    birthday DATE 
  ); 

2. Add Ororo Munroe to friends. Her birthday is May 30th, 1940.
  INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) VALUES (1, 'Ororo Munroe', '1940-05-30'); 

3. Add two of your friends to the table.
  INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) VALUES (2, 'Jane Doe', '1999-04-19'); 
  INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) VALUES (3, 'John Smith', '1997-09-10'); 

4. Ororo Munroe just realized that she can control the weather and decided to change her name. Her new name is “Storm”. Update her record in friends.
  UPDATE friends 
    SET name = 'Storm'
    WHERE id = 1; 

5. Add a new column named email.
  ALTER TABLE friends 
    ADD COLUMN email TEXT; 

6. Update the email address for everyone in your table. Storm’s email is storm@codecademy.com
  UPDATE friends 
    SET email = 'storm@codeacadamy.com'
    WHERE id = 1;
  UPDATE friends 
    SET email = 'jane@codeacadamy.com'
    WHERE id = 2;  
  UPDATE friends 
    SET email = 'john@codeacadamy.com'
    WHERE id = 3;  

7. Storm is fictional… Remove her from friends.
  DELETE FROM friends 
  WHERE id = 1;
