In this SQL, I queried a database with multiple tables to quantify stats about customer and monthly order data. 


#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
   SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
  SELECT count(Product) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE Product = 'iPhone'AND length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
    
#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
  SELECT BIT_DB.customers.acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers
    INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
    ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
    WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
  SELECT distinct Product, MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    ORDER BY price LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
  SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    GROUP BY product 

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
  SELECT SUM(Quantity), product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location ='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
    GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
  SELECT feb.orderID, AVG(feb.quantity*feb.price) AS total, count(cust.acctnum) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
      LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust ON feb.orderid = cust.order_id 
      WHERE feb.quantity > 2 AND length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold. 
   SELECT Product, SUM(quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
    WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
    GROUP BY Product

#9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
   SELECT distinct location, count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
      WHERE location LIKE '%NY%' AND length(orderid) = 6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
      GROUP BY location 
      HAVING count(orderID) > 2

#10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
   SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
      WHERE Product LIKE '%Headphones%'
      GROUP BY product 

#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February? 
   SELECT orderID, SUM(Quantity*price)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
      JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
      ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
      WHERE length(orderid) = 6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 
    SELECT SUM(feb.Quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
       LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
       ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
      WHERE length(orderid) = 6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
    SELECT product, COUNT(Quantity), price, COUNT(Quantity)*price as revenue  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
      WHERE length(orderid) = 6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
      GROUP BY Product
      ORDER BY revenue DESC LIMIT 1
