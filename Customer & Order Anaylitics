In this SQL, I queried a database with multiple tables to quantify stats about customer and monthly order data. 


#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
   SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
  SELECT count(Product) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE Product = 'iPhone'AND length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
    
#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
  SELECT BIT_DB.customers.acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers
    INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
    ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
    WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
  SELECT distinct Product, MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    ORDER BY price LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
  SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    GROUP BY product 

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
  SELECT SUM(Quantity), product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location ='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
    GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers
  SELECT feb.orderID, AVG(feb.quantity*feb.price) AS total, count(cust.acctnum) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
      LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust ON feb.orderid = cust.order_id 
      WHERE feb.quantity > 2 AND length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
